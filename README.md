# WESTERN-COUNTRIES-FINANCIAL-PERFORMANCE-DASHBOARD
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales, profit, discounts, and performance across products, segments, and Western countries (2013–2014).

📊 Financial Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard built to analyze the financial performance of a retail dataset.
It highlights sales trends, profit drivers, discounting patterns, and performance across products, segments, and geographies to uncover actionable business insights.

🚀 Executive Summary
Scale: 1.13M units → $118.7M sales → $12.1M profit (≈10.2% margin; ~$105 revenue & ~$10.7 profit per unit).
Momentum: From 2013 → 2014: Sales +249% (26.4M → 92.3M), Profit +644% (1.43M → 10.64M). Margins nearly doubled (5.4% → 11.5%).
Profit hotspots: Germany ($3.3M) and Mexico ($3.0M) lead in profit, even though they’re not top revenue contributors. USA/Canada face margin pressure.
Profit draggers: Amarilla (-23M) and VTT (-22M) erase a significant share of profit despite high sales.

📈 Growth & Seasonality
Strongest quarter: Q4-2014 → $29.8M sales & $6.0M profit (clear peak).
Weakest quarter: Q3-2013 → loss of ~$0.4M.
Warning sign: Q2-2014 → High sales ($22.7M) but negligible profit (~$0.2M), indicating heavy discounting or cost spikes.

🌍 Geographic Insights
Top revenue markets: USA (25M), Canada (24.9M), France (24.4M), Germany (23.5M), Mexico (21M).
Top profit markets: Germany & Mexico.
Insight: North America drives volume but with weaker margins compared to Europe/LatAm.

🏢 Segment Profitability
Profit engines: Small Business (+26M), Government (+8M), Enterprise (+4M).
Loss makers: Midmarket (-12M), Channel Partners (-15M).
👉 If Midmarket & Channel Partners break even, total profit could rise from ~12M → ~39M.

📦 Product Performance & Discounting
Top seller: Paseo ($33M, ~28% of revenue).
Loss makers: Amarilla (-23M), VTT (-22M), Velo (-1M).
Discount impact: Heaviest-discounted SKUs (Amarilla, VTT, Velo) are least profitable.
Product–segment fit: Certain products perform well in Government/Small Business, but destroy value in Midmarket/Channel Partners.

🔍 Unit Economics & Mix
2014 share: 76% of total units (861K/1.13M) → growth is volume-led and margin-accretive.
Low volume ≠ weak performance: e.g., Carretera (~147K units) remains margin-healthy (lowest discounts, not in the loss list).

⚠️ Key Challenges Identified
Over-discounting of Amarilla, VTT, Velo.
Geographic mix issues — USA/Canada generate high volume but lower margins.
Segment misfit — Wrong SKUs targeted in Midmarket & Channel Partners.
